                Ice cream also has a “community” aspect on a number of different levels. On one of the most personal and
                memorable ends of the scale, ice cream is a favorite addition to a family dinner. For the many whose
                meals are not complete without a dessert, family members will certainly state that ice cream is at or at
                least near the top of their list of favorites.

            <p class="txtfont">It’s very nutritious, and eating it regularly may boost several aspects of your health.
                For example, yogurt has been found to reduce the risk of heart disease and osteoporosis, as well as aid
                in weight management.

            <h1 class="txtClr">What is yogurt and how is it made?</h1>
            <p class="txtfont">Yogurt is a popular dairy product made by the bacterial fermentation of milk.

                The bacteria used to make yogurt are called “yogurt cultures,” which ferment lactose, the natural sugar
                found in milk. This process produces lactic acid, a substance that causes milk proteins to curdle,
                giving yogurt its unique flavor and texture.

                Yogurt can be made from all types of milk. Varieties made from skim milk are considered fat-free,
                whereas whole milk options are considered full fat.

                Plain yogurt without added colorants is a white, thick liquid with a tangy flavor. However, most
                commercial brands contain added ingredients, such as sugar and artificial flavors.

                Here are six science-based health benefits of natural yogurt.</p>
